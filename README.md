# Virtual Memory Manager 

__Description:__  
This is a virtual memory manager written in C meant to simulate the page replacement process and  
the virtual memory management within an operating system.  

_Page Replacement Algorithm:_ 
The algorithm used for page replacement is LRU (Least Recently Used); implemented using a  
doubly linked list.  

_note:_ This project is still a work in progress.
